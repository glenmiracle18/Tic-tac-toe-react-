## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Welcome to my React Tic-Tac-Toe project! This endeavor showcases my proficiency in React as I bring the classic game of tic-tac-toe to life with an interactive and dynamic user interface. With a focus on creating a seamless two-player gaming experience, I've implemented a responsive 3x3 grid, a robust winner declaration system, and a unique time travel feature. The time travel functionality allows players to explore the game's history, undo moves, and experiment with different strategies. By building this project, I've honed my skills in state management, component architecture, and UI/UX design within the React framework. Join in the fun, explore the codebase, and perhaps contribute to the project's growth!
